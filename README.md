# Budget Tracker
## Description
### Modifed starter code to provide functionality to a budget tracking application. This app lets the user add transactions to their database as they complete them and provides a visualization of their results. This app also allows users to update their entries while offline, and once connected back to the internet, will update their transactions with the offline data.
